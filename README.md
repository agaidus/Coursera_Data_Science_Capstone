###Johns Hopkins / Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone

Natural language processing (NLP) is the science of applying computational models to human text and speech data. The purpose of this project is to use NLP to build an n-gram predictive text model that will calculate the most likely next word from a user-specified string of text input. The n-gram dataset is built from a corpus called the HC Corpora. This corpus contains text from news, blogs, and twitter. The predictive model is then built off of this dataset. The final product is a web-based shiny application that predicts the next word based on user-input

- "Week_1" contains the code used to read in and answer some basic questions about the dataset.
- "Week_2" contains a markdown file that uses natural language processing modules in R (tm and RWeka) to do some exploratory analysis, build a corpus, and calculate initial n-gram frequencies
- "Final_Project" contains the code used to build the final shiny application and R Presentation.
